# project-data-json-viewer

Implement a web app with the following:

1. A file input that allows uploading a JSON file 
2. After file upload, parse the JSON and extract the unique project IDs from the "data" object
3. Render a select dropdown populated with the extracted project IDs
4. When a project is selected, filter the edits to only those belonging to the selected project (based on the edit ID path)
5. Sort the filtered edits by the "created_at.__time__" timestamp in descending order
6. Display the sorted edits in a list, showing:
   - created_at formatted date
   - created_by 
   - status
   - content.output (if defined) with code blocks and newlines rendered properly

Use Shadcn UI components where suitable. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
